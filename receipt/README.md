This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

#Add lines below for each request:

Please create recipe web site for us. Please only update Home Page UI for now. We want a simple design. After then, we will begin to implment superbase database. We are not using src folder.

Product Requirements Document (PRD) below:

Project Name: Recipe

Objective: To build a web application where users can upload and browse recipes, leveraging Next.js for the frontend and Supabase for the backend (database and authentication).

Core Features

Password reset functionality.

Recipe Management:

Users can upload recipes with details like title, ingredients, steps, and an optional image.

Users can view a detailed page for each recipe.

Search and Filtering:

Basic keyword search functionality.

Filter recipes by category (e.g., appetizers, desserts, main courses).

Responsive Design:

Ensure the platform is mobile-friendly and provides a seamless user experience on all devices.

Technical Stack

Supabase for database and authentication hosting



#========================
Questions to ask AI:

1.
I just created a superbase project and enabled authentication for email only. 

Can you help me with the database table setup?

2. 
Just to show you how this works initially before we start creating tons of tables.
asek AI: Can you create only two tables to start (No categories). 

So the first is a profiles table(id, username, full name, created at, updated at)

Second is the recipes table(id, created at,User ID title, ingredients, instructions, cooking time,Difficulty,category)

3.
asek AI: 
We have created 2 database table in superbase [profiles and recipes]. Please reference this image so you know what fields have in each of the two data tabels. 

Now lets go ahead and start the initial setup of superbase in this project. Please walk me through this. 


4. Follow instructions from step 3:

5. ask AI:
we have populated .env file inside our  codebase. 

can you just implement a quick test on our home page to make sure we are connected to superbase?
